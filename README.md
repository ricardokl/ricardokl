# Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹
## This is my github profile

I am a PhD in Physics, with interests in Mathematics and programming.

For my published papers in Physics, you can find most of them in
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/): [My
Papers](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Kullock%2C+R)

For my engagement in programing, I've been mainly working with python, but I
also end up using bash, since my system of choice is Linux (Manjaro). I've also recently taken some interest in rust.

I've also got a "dotfiles" repo here, and not many actual dotfiles there ðŸ¤£. The
repo contains many configuration files, and some scripts.

My editor of choice is neovim, currently moving to the lua config and plugins.
